# Future Project Ideas

## Tag Health Monitoring Dashboard
- **Sources**: GA4 BigQuery export, GTM container config (via API), server-side logs
- **Goal**: Pipeline that monitors event completeness — are all expected tags firing? Are there anomalies in event volumes?
- **Final table**: Daily tag health scorecard (events expected vs received, error rates, latency)
- **Why it's strong**: Unique angle — very niche to Tag Management expertise
