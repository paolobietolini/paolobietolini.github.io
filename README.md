# Learn in Public (LIP)

This repository is a public log of my learning journey. It contains notes, exercises, and code written while studying **C programming** and **Data Engineering**.

The goal is to document progress, share what I learn, and build a solid foundation through consistent practice.

## Repository Structure

* **[C](/c)**
  
  Notes and exercises related to the C programming language.
  Learning resources:

  * *“Impariamo il C”* — YouTube series by Salvatore Sanfilippo (Antirez)
  * *“The C Programming Language”* — Kernighan & Ritchie (K&R)

* **[Data Engineering](/data-engineering)**
  
  Notes, exercises, and experiments related to Data Engineering concepts, tools and projects.

## Goals

* Become proficient in **C** to better understand low-level software mechanics
* Build strong **Data Engineering** skills to transition from my current role in **MarTech** as a Digital Analyst / Implementation Specialist

## Notes on Language

* The language used in this repository may vary depending on the learning source
  (for example, notes from Antirez’s course are written in Italian)

## Why Learn in Public?

Learning in public helps me:
- Stay accountable and consistent
- Reinforce concepts by writing them down and explaining them
- Track progress over time
- Share resources and insights that may be useful to others on a similar path
- This repository is not meant to showcase perfect code, but real progress.
